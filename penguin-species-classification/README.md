### 📊 Overview
We use `bill_length_mm` and `flipper_length_mm` to classify penguins into three species:
- Adelie
- Gentoo
- Chinstrap

The models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion matrix
- Visual decision boundaries

### ✅ Key Results
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** 96%
- **Linear Regression Accuracy:** 94.2%
- Logistic regression had clearer decision boundaries and fewer misclassifications.
