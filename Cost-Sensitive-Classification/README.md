# 💰 Cost-Sensitive Classification

**Course:** Data Preparation and Analysis  
**Project Goal:** Improve prediction outcomes by incorporating business cost considerations into classification models.

---

## 🧠 Description

This project demonstrates how to adjust binary classification predictions using cost-sensitive evaluation.  
Instead of focusing only on model accuracy or F1 score, it applies utility functions to reflect real-world business consequences for false positives and false negatives.
