# 👋 Hi, I'm Nima

I'm a Revenue Analyst and a Master of Data Science student at Illinois Tech.  
This portfolio highlights real-world projects in SQL, R, Python, relational databases, and time series forecasting.

## 🗂️ Featured Projects

### 🐧 [Penguin Species Classification](./penguin-species-classification/)

Compared linear regression and logistic regression for classifying penguins using flipper and bill measurements.  
Visualized decision boundaries and evaluated with confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.  
**Techniques:** One-hot encoding, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib

### 💼 [Income Classification Using Statistical Learning](./income-classification-statistical-learning/)

Used linear models, logistic regression, and decision trees to classify individuals by income level based on census data.  
Handled class imbalance, outliers, and categorical variables; evaluated with AUC, F1, and confusion matrix.  
**Techniques:** Data preprocessing, model tuning, ROC curve, classification metrics


### 📘 [Relational Database Design](./Order-Normalization-Project/)
Normalized an order-tracking dataset to BCNF, derived functional dependencies, and designed ER diagrams.

### [US Inflation Analysis (2010–2023)](./Inflation-EDA-Analysis/)

Exploratory analysis of U.S. inflation trends using CPI data from 2010 to 2023.  
Techniques: Time-series analysis, Pandas, Matplotlib

### 🚕 [Chicago Taxi Trip Data Analysis](./Taxi-Trip-Data-Analysis/)

EDA on Chicago taxi trips using distance, duration, and cleanup rules.  
Includes visuals and correlation insights.

### 🛒 [Market Basket Analysis](./Market-Basket-Analysis/)

Unsupervised learning project using Apriori algorithm to uncover product associations.  
Shows frequent itemsets, support, confidence, and lift insights.

### 🧮 [Customer RFM Segmentation](./Customer-RFM-Segmentation/)

Analyzed customer transactions to create meaningful segments using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scoring.  
Used for retention, loyalty, and high-value targeting.

### 🧮 [Classification Evaluation](./Classification-Evaluation)

Tuned binary classification models using F1 score optimization and confusion matrix analysis.  
Techniques: Threshold tuning, model evaluation, binary classification 

### 💰 [Cost-Sensitive Classification](./Cost-Sensitive-Classification)

Adjusted classification predictions using utility functions to reflect business impact and costs.  
Techniques: Cost-sensitive learning, decision support, model evaluation
