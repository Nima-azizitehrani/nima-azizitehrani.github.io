# ðŸ§ª Classification Evaluation

**Course:** Data Preparation and Analysis  
**Project:** Tuning classification models with F1 score and confusion matrix

## ðŸ“„ Description
This project focuses on optimizing binary classification performance using F1 score tuning.  
It evaluates model predictions, adjusts thresholds, and interprets results via confusion matrices.

## ðŸ”§ Techniques Used
- F1 score optimization
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Binary classification evaluation

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `optimal threshold using F1.html`: Demonstrates how to tune thresholds to optimize the F1 score

## ðŸ§  Skills
Binary classification, threshold tuning, model evaluation

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run all cells to follow the classification evaluation workflow.
3. The dataset is included or generated within the notebook.
